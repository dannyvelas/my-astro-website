    Hi! My name is Danny. I currently work as a software engineer and team lead
    at Walmart. I like learning about programming languages, software design
    patterns, and system development. I plan to post here some of the thoughts
    that I have and some of the things I'm interested in.

        <li>
          <a class="hover:underline" href={post.url}>
            {post.frontmatter.title}
          </a>
        </li>
      ))
